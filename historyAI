While thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[13] the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE). With his Calculus ratiocinator, Gottfried Leibniz extended the concept of the calculating machine (Wilhelm Schickard engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers.[14] Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel ÄŒapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).[
