While thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in 
antiquity,[13] the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with
Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE). With his Calculus ratiocinator, Gottfried Leibniz extended the concept of the calculating machine 
(Wilhelm Schickard engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers.[14] 
Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.
(Rossum's Universal Robots).

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. 
In the 19th century, George Boole refined those ideas into propositional 
logic and Gottlob Frege developed a notational system for mechanical reasoning (a "predicate calculus").
